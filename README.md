<div align="justify"> Mainly, we aim the simulation of stochastic computing (SC) circuits targetted for imgae processing applications. In this we presen several circuit structures for the fast and efficient simulation without using bitstreams as conventional SC systems require (and simulations generally utilze them.) Since SC circuits work with long bitstreams (e.g. 1024 bit binary packages 1010010101...101), latency and memory issues occur inevitably. We show how contingency construct can efficiently simulate SC and degrades latency and memory problems. <div align="justify">
