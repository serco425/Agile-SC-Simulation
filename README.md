<div align="justify"> Mainly, we aim to simulate stochastic computing (SC) circuits targeted for image processing applications. In this respect, we analyze the contingency table (CT) method for several circuit structures proposing a fast and efficient simulation without using actual bitstreams as conventional SC systems require (so do the traditional simulation approaches.) Since SC circuits work with long bitstreams (e.g., 1024-bit binary packages 1010010101...101), latency and memory issues inevitably occur in a software simulation. We show how CT construct can efficiently simulate SC and degrades the latency. <div align="justify">

There are four folders in this project:
  
1. Cascaded circuit simulation (Figure 5 (b) in the manuscript)

2. Image processing simulation <br />
  
3. NAND gate-based XOR model for the monitoring of reconvergent paths (*with* and *without* reconvergence) <br />
  
4. 2-bit ripple carry adder circuit structure for the monitoring of reconvergent paths (*with* and *without* reconvergence) <br />
   (arithmetic operation is not the main aim; the complexity of the circuit does matter.) <br />
